         like f(2)<sup>n</sup> <abbr title="Centi Meter">CM</abbr> is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions.<i> It helps us to understand the changes between the 
         values which are related by a function.</i> Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation,
          integration, limits, functions</b>, and so on. Scientific calculation provide formilas like: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
